## ðŸ“š Description

Demonstrates how to create arbitrary abstract types, and whose implementation might be loaded from defined entry points without direct dependencies.

## ðŸŽ¯ Pros

- **Dynamically select an implementation** of a type without modifying source code using it.
- No need to reference implementation dependencies in code using type (**avoid unnecessary requirements**).
- Implementations of a type may be provided by
  - package defining the type
  - third-party packages
  - or directly in application using it

## ðŸš« Cons

- Implementations may only be provided through entry points, meaning that they must belong to a package.
