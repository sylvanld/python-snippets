# Python Snippets

This repository versions python code snippets that might be reused to improve application structure.

## Snippets

- [Dynamic driver selection](./dynamic_driver_selection/README.md): Provide a way to load subclass using a method from parent class (driver type).
- [Extensible request context](./extensible_request_context/README.md) Demonstrates how a class may provide both extensibility, strict typing with minimal boilerplate.

## Brainstorming

- [SQLAlchemy readonly session](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/5815#issuecomment-1119104934) may be used to enfore good CQRS practice in application.
